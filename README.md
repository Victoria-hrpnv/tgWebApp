# Telegram Mini Apps React

Single-page application on the Telegram Mini Apps platform using the following technologies
and libraries:

- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [@telegram-apps SDK](https://docs.telegram-mini-apps.com/packages/telegram-apps-sdk/2-x)
- [Telegram UI](https://github.com/Telegram-Mini-Apps/TelegramUI)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)


## Install Dependencies

If you have just cloned this template, you should install the project
dependencies using the command:

```Bash
npm install
```

## Scripts

This project contains the following scripts:

- `dev`. Runs the application in development mode.
- `dev:https`. Runs the application in development mode using locally created valid SSL-certificates.

To run a script, use the `npm run` command:

```Bash
npm run {script}
# Example: npm run build
```

To run the application in the development mode, use the `dev` script:

```bash
npm run dev:https
```

It is important to note that some libraries in this template, such as
`@telegram-apps/sdk`, are not intended for use outside of Telegram.

Nevertheless, they appear to function properly. This is because the
`src/mockEnv.ts` file, which is imported in the application's entry point (
`src/index.ts`), employs the `mockTelegramEnv` function to simulate the Telegram
environment. This trick convinces the application that it is running in a
Telegram-based environment. Therefore, be cautious not to use this function in
production mode unless you fully understand its implications.
